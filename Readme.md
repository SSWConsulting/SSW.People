# SSW People

This is a Gatsby generated website, leveraging data from SSW.People.Profiles (GitHub) and SSW CRM. Pages are automatically re-generated and published to our SSW website when a profile markdown page is updated.

**SSW People** is the **SSW Employee Pages V2** - No more SharePoint!

This is a Gatsby generated site pulling data from:

- [SSW Profiles GitHub Repository](https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.People.Profiles)
- Dynamics CRM

## Getting Started

### Required Tools

- Install nodejs via <https://nodejs.org/en/> (LTS Version, last tested with 20)
- Install yarn via <https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/> (Used for package management)
  
### Getting ready for development

- Clone the repo from <https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.People>
- Run *yarn* (or *npm install*) to install packages
- Create environment files (.env.development and .env.production) and copy the environment variables for SSW People on Keeper into both files
- **Note**: You will need to update .env.template as well as the keeper record if you add any new environment variables

### Development

1. Branch off main for your PBI
2. Run the site in development mode - *yarn dev* (or *npm run-script dev*) (.env.development is required for this step)
3. Do your work
4. Build the site in production mode - *yarn build* (or *npm run-script build*) (.env.production is required for this step)
5. Commit code and push
6. Raise a PR
7. Get it merged!

### Definition of Done

- Code Compiles
- Check the Acceptance Criteria.
- Code is squash-merged to main via a pull request that was approved by a 2nd developer.
- Another team member agrees itâ€™s ready for Production.
- Pushed to Production.
- Use @Mention (**OR** Send email) to notify Product Owner/PBI stakeholder that PBI is done (be sure to include screenshots/done video as proof) 

> <As per rule: [Done - Do you go beyond 'Done' and follow a 'Definition of Done'](https://rules.ssw.com.au/done-do-you-go-beyond-done-and-follow-a-definition-of-done)?>

### Branches

- Branching strategy is based off [Release Flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/devops-at-microsoft/release-flow)
- **Main** is the main 'dev' branch
- **Release/xx** is the 'production' one (where xx is incremented from the previous release)
- Always create a new branch for your PBIs
- Always delete your branch once your PR has been merged

### Builds

- Changes made to https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.People.Profiles (i.e. profile changes) trigger builds that deploy:
  - **main** to the **staging** - check the [latest staging workflow](https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.People/deployments/staging) for the url
  - latest **release/xx** to the **production** site: <https://www.ssw.com.au/people>
  
- Branching off **main** to **release/xx**, or making changes to **release/xx** will build and deploy to the **production** site: <https://www.ssw.com.au/people>

> Note: people.ssw.com.au redirects to <https://www.ssw.com.au/people>

### People profiles repository

> People profiles repository lives here: <https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.People.Profiles>
>
- Sample Profile: <https://www.ssw.com.au/people/bob-northwind>

Merging changes to **main** on this repo will trigger:

- a build/release of the **main** branch in Staging - check the [latest staging workflow](https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.People/deployments/staging) for the url
- a build/release of the **release** branch Production (https://www.ssw.com.au/people)
