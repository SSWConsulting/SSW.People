3. Do your work
4. Run the site in development mode by *yarn develop* (or *npm run-script develop*) (.env.development is required for this step)
5. Commit code and push
6. Raise a PR
7. Get it merged!

### Definition of Done

- Code Compiles
- Check the Acceptance Criteria.
- Code is squash-merged to main via a pull request that was approved by a 2nd developer.
- Another team member agrees itâ€™s ready for Production.
- Pushed to Production.
- Use @Mention (**OR** Send email) to notify Product Owner/PBI stakeholder that PBI is done (be sure to include screenshots/done video as proof) 

> <As per rule: [Done - Do you go beyond 'Done' and follow a 'Definition of Done'](https://rules.ssw.com.au/done-do-you-go-beyond-done-and-follow-a-definition-of-done)?>

### Branches

- Branching strategy is based off [Release Flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/devops-at-microsoft/release-flow)
- **Main** is the main 'dev' branch
- **Release/xx** is the 'production' one (where xx is the Sprint number)
- Always create a new branch for your PBIs
- Always delete your branch once your PR has been merged

### Builds

- Changes made to http://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.People.Profiles (i.e. profile changes) trigger builds that deploy:
  - **main** to the **staging** site: <https://staging.ssw.com.au/people/>
  - latest **release/xx** to the **production** site: <https://www.ssw.com.au/people>
  
- Branching off **main** to **release/xx**, or making changes to **release/xx** will build and deploy to the **production** site: <https://www.ssw.com.au/people>

> Note: people.ssw.com.au redirects to <https://www.ssw.com.au/people>

### People profiles repository

> People profiles repository lives here: <https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.People.Profiles>
>
- Sample Profile:
  - Staging: <https://staging.ssw.com.au/people/bob-northwind>
  - Production: <https://www.ssw.com.au/people/bob-northwind>

Merging changes to **main** on this repo will trigger:

- a build/release of the **main** branch in Staging (https://staging.ssw.com.au/people/)
- a build/release of the **release** branch Production (https://www.ssw.com.au/people)
